          If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.

          Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
          kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
          the questions about Mucse cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
          your specific card in the following questions.
